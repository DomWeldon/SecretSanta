# Secret Santa Rules

1. Everyone is randomly assigned a person for whom to buy a gift.
2. The identity of the giver is kept secret.
3. Assignment is done by drawing names out of a hat.

## Challenge 1

How would you write some code to assign these names randomly, as if you were drawing the names out of a hat?

## Challenge 2

Let's imagine two people cannot buy gifts for eachother. How would you incorporate this into your algorithm?

## Challenge 3

Do a PhD on the Secret Santa Problem (Hamiltonian Path finding, NP-complete).
